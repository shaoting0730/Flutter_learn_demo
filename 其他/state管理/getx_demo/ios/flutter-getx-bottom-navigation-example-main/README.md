# Flutter Getx - Bottom Navigation Bar Example

In this example, we made a bottom navigation bar using GetX state management, we tried to write less code and separate the logics used.

This example is the second part of the Flutter GetX video series we have covered the following titles:

- Creating pages and GetX controllers
- Creating BottomNavigationBar
- Using GetBuilder widget
- Using controller parameters inside page
- A small counter (Bonus)
